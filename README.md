[**Demo**](http://webjeda.com/hagura)

Hagura is a theme made for blogs with long text paragraphs. Made to be easy on eyes as well with a switchable theme.

Suitable fonts are selected for better readability. Since the theme is created for smartphone reading, the theme is very light and it loads instantly even on a slow data connection.
