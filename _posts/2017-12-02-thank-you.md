I'm glad that you guys have liked and supported the theme to reach 100 stars on Github. I would like to thank everyone who has supported the theme by using, starring and recommending it.

Themes get better when people contribute. That is how our [Online CV](https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv){: target="_blank"} got more than 250 likes. I would like to ask users to suggest changes and if possible create a pull-request.

You can still do it if you haven't yet,

<!-- Place this tag where you want the button to render. -->
<a class="github-button" href="https://github.com/sharu725/hagura" data-icon="octicon-star" data-size="large" data-show-count="true" aria-label="Star sharu725/hagura on GitHub">Star</a>
<script async defer src="https://buttons.github.io/buttons.js"></script>

Thank you
