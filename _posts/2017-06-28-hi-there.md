## Hi there! 

I am a software developer working on distributed systems and big data analytics. I am interested in distributed systems and concurrency. I am currently working at [Helpshift](https://www.helpshift.com/). 

I [write code](https://github.com/mourjo) and like to [write about code](https://medium.com/@mourjo_sen). I spoke at the Clojure conference [IN/Clojure 2019](https://speakerdeck.com/mourjo/a-fair-task-execution-framework). I have done a [research internship]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/master_thesis_MourjoSen.pdf) at [Inria](http://www.inria.fr/en/centre/sophia). 

I am always looking for interesting projects to work on, if you have something cool in mind, do get in touch! 

Live long and prosper!
