## Hi there! 

I am a Software Developer at [Helpshift](https://www.helpshift.com/)! I helped build a low-latency [search engine](https://support.helpshift.com/kb/article/what-is-advanced-search-and-how-do-i-use-it/) which internally offloads costly database queries.

My MS degree included a [research internship]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/master_thesis_MourjoSen.pdf) at [Inria](http://www.inria.fr/en/centre/sophia) on finding spam on Twitter by analyzing the Twitter social graph. 

I am interested in stream-processing applications, functional programming and blockchains. 

I am a foodie, a true-blue Bengali and would love to talk to you about Computer Science and Software Development over a cup of coffee!
