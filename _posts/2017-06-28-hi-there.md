## Hi there! 

I am a Software Developer at [Helpshift](https://www.helpshift.com/) working on distributed systems which handle 180K requests/second, concurrent applications, benchmarking services and generative test suites.

I have spoken at the Clojure conference [IN/Clojure 2019](https://speakerdeck.com/mourjo/a-fair-task-execution-framework) on usage of communicating sequential processes. I have done a [research internship]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/master_thesis_MourjoSen.pdf) at [Inria](http://www.inria.fr/en/centre/sophia) on finding spam on Twitter by analyzing the Twitter social graph. 

I am interested in stream processing, distributed systems, concurrency, software scale and functional programming!
